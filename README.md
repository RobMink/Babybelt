**Design philosophy and considerations in order of importance:**

Cheap. Target price if put into mass production around $100. During development and bootstrapping periods $200. 

Cheap. I know we said that already but it's important.

Simple and easy to assemble

Reuse of common parts and limiting of fasteners

Assembled printer must fit in the priority mail prepaid box. 




**What makes the baby belt special**

Use of smallest cheapest stepper motors ever

Use of 3mm round rods with 3mm PtfE tubes used as bearings

Simple laminated belt made from fabric and paper along with use of jigs for repeatability. 

Smallest belt printer ever (as of right now)

Cantilever arm

Easily broken down for storage or transport and easy setup with two clip together assemblies for the whole machine.

Sensorless homing.

Aerodynamic exit ramp for parts.

Only two types of screws used for every thing (discipline design approach reducing overall BOM cost)
